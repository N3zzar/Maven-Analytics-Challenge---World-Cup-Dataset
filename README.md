## Project Description

This was a challenge from Maven analytics that i worked on. It feautured a sport domain dataset. Even though the sports domain is not a domain i have enough knowledge on, i wanted to try it out. I embarked on it to present information in a visually appealing format

--------
## Project Objectives

The objective of this challenge was to Visualize a country's history in the world cup,their road to Qatar, and their expectations for the tournament.

-------
## Data Gathering

This dataset had already been provided by Maven analaytics.


-------
## Data transformation

1. Loaded all the dataset i was suppose to load
2. I converted the data-type to the correct ones for each columns in the data that was loaded
3. I merged some queries to get a surrogate key to connect some data together
4. Did some other insignificant cleanings


--------
## Data modelling

I made use of Snowflake Schema

## Conclusion

One of the roles of being a data analysts is presenting information in a visually apealing and informative format and here is what i set out to achieve while working on this project. I got to implement cool things i learn as well, one of which was use of dynamic DAX et cetera. I also explored the various types of interactions we have like the filter, highlight, none. I also made use of new visuals like map, treemap, decomposition tree. I also used a snowflake schema instead of the common star schema.
